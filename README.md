## üßë‚Äçüíª Technical Overview & Next.js Concepts

### Static Generation (SSG)
- **Home page (`/`)**:
  - Statically generated at build time (no fetch from API route).
  - Categories data is imported directly for reliability & fast builds.

### Dynamic Routing & Data Fetching
- **Category pages (`/quizzes/[category]`):**
  - Dynamic, lists quizzes using URL params.
  - Merges static quizzes + user-contributed quizzes from browser.

- **Individual quizzes (`/quiz/[id]`):**
  - Dynamic, uses browser state for quiz progress.
  - Supports both static and user-created quizzes.

### API Routes
- `/api/categories` ‚Äî Returns all quiz categories.
- `/api/quizzes/[category]` ‚Äî Lists quizzes by category.
- `/api/quiz/[id]` ‚Äî Returns full quiz details.

### Image Optimization
- All images rendered with the `next/image` component for best performance.

### Styling
- Built with Tailwind CSS for rapid development and easy customization.

## üìù Design Decisions

- **Home page SSG** imports category data directly (never fetches its own API during build).
- **APIs are served for runtime usage** (client-side or SSR).
- **Admin quiz creation** happens only in the browser, using `localStorage`‚Äîsafe for demo and Vercel hosting.
- **Stateful quiz flow** is managed on the client for fast, interactive experience.
- **Easily extendable** to use real backends or databases‚Äîdata models are simple and clear.
- **SEO:** 
  - Uses titles and meta descriptions for each main route.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing

- Major quiz and UI components tested manually (taking quizzes, admin, leaderboard).
- Error states (quiz not found, empty leaderboard, etc.) are handled.
- (Easy to add automated tests with Jest/React Testing Library in the future.)

---

## ‚ö° Challenges & Resolutions

- **Vercel SSG Build Error:**  
  - _Problem_: Initial build failed due to `fetch('/api/categories')` at build time.
  - _Solution_: Switched to direct data import for SSG, per Next.js best practices.
- **Hydration Warnings:**  
  - Ensured browser-only state/features are marked with `"use client";` and handled state properly.
- **Dynamic `localStorage` data:**  
  - Admin quizzes and leaderboard use client-only logic.

---

## üí° Helpful Notes

- To reset custom quizzes or scores, clear browser `localStorage`.
- This is a demo app; APIs and data sources can be replaced by real services as needed!
- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) is an excellent resource.
